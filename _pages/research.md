          As economies develop, they increasingly rely on services intermediates in production. While recent research highlights the importance of these shifts for aggregate dynamics, the mechanisms underlying them remain understudied. This paper quantifies the role of biased, intermediates-specific technical change as a key mechanism behind the rise of services intermediates -- and its implications for broader structural transformation and aggregate growth -- using a two-sector model with intermediates-specific technical change and a full input-output structure. Calibrated with U.S. data, the model indicates that input-specific technical change has been driving the majority of the rise in services intermediates in the services-producing sector, but not in the goods-producing sector. This heterogeneity accounts for both the stagnation of value-added productivity in services and several aggregate trends: almost half of the increase in the services' share of intermediates and employment, roughly one-quarter of the rise in final expenditure shares, and approximately a 25% reduction in aggregate real GDP growth relative to an unbiased counterfactual. These findings establish biased intermediates-specific technical change as a central driver of the evolving production structure, the aggregate productivity slowdown, and structural transformation.

          Economic progress brings with it two key patterns. Firstly, we observe the progressive aging of the population. Secondly, as nations' economies grow, the portion of food in total aggregate expenditures tends to decrease. Using country and household-level expenditure data from 20 countries across the entire development spectrum, this work documents that, as the age of household members increases, the proportion of total household expenditures dedicated to food also increases. A large heterogeneity between rich and developing countries emerges when using household-level variables -- such as head's and average age -- as standard in existing literature. This gap disappears when considering the exact household composition. This finding suggests that -- at any development level -- the demographic transition leads to a higher overall food share of total expenditures, slowing down structural transformation out of food consumption. I test this hypothesis by constructing a quantitative model that accounts for household demographic composition and documents that the demographic transition is a sizable force that slows down structural transformation. Due to the observed co-movement of demographic transition, structural change, and income growth, not accounting for demography leads to an underestimation of the income effect in almost all countries in the sample.
