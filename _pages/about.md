Welcome to my personal website!

- I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at [GSEFM](https://www.gsefm.eu/about-us.html) and [Goethe University Frankfurt](https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/en).

- I am a macroeconomist interested in how long-run forces—such as demographic change and technological progress—shape the structure of the economy. 

- My current research focuses on the role of demand-side mechanisms in explaining cross-country differences, using both empirical analysis and quantitative models.

### **Intermediates-Specific Technical Change, Structural Transformation, and Growth**

**Abstract**: *As economies develop, they increasingly rely on services intermediates in production. While recent research highlights the importance of these shifts for aggregate dynamics, the mechanisms underlying them remain understudied. This paper quantifies the role of biased, intermediates-specific technical change as a key mechanism behind the rise of services intermediates -- and its implications for broader structural transformation and aggregate growth -- using a two-sector model with intermediates-specific technical change and a full input-output structure. Calibrated with U.S. data, the model indicates that input-specific technical change has been driving the majority of the rise in services intermediates in the services-producing sector, but not in the goods-producing sector. This heterogeneity accounts for both the stagnation of value-added productivity in services and several aggregate trends: almost half of the increase in the services' share of intermediates and employment, roughly one-quarter of the rise in final expenditure shares, and approximately a 25% reduction in aggregate real GDP growth relative to an unbiased counterfactual. These findings establish biased intermediates-specific technical change as a central driver of the evolving production structure, the aggregate productivity slowdown, and structural transformation.*
