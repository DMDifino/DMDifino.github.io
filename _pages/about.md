Welcome to my personal website!

- I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at [GSEFM](https://www.gsefm.eu/about-us.html) and [Goethe University Frankfurt](https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/en).

- I am a macroeconomist interested in how long-run forces—such as demographic change and technological progress—shape the structure of the economy. 

- My current research focuses on the role of demand-side mechanisms in explaining cross-country differences, using both empirical analysis and quantitative models.

## *Job Market Paper:* **Technical and Structural Change**   [[slides](http://dmdifino.github.io/files/technical_change_3_10_25.pdf)]

**Abstract**: *As countries develop, the service share of aggregate intermediate inputs rises. This paper studies the role of intermediate-biased technical change in driving these phenomena and broader structural transformation.*

*Using cross-country input-output data from 1965 to 2014, this work documents that the rising service share of intermediate inputs reflects broad within-sector increases in service intensity rather than reallocation across industries. Standard drivers such as relative price changes explain part, but not all, of this shift. To interpret these facts, this work proposes a parsimonious two-sector model with input-biased technical change and a full input-output structure.* 

*A novel estimation strategy using U.S. data indicates that technical change has been service-biased in the services-producing sector and neutral in the goods-producing sector. Quantitatively, service-biased technical change accounts for half of the rise in the service share of intermediates and employment, one-quarter of the increase in the service expenditure share, and a 25 percent decline in aggregate GDP. These findings establish input-biased technical change as a central force shaping structural transformation and aggregate growth.*
